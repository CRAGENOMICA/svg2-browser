  experiment_description:
    Arabidopsis root longitudinal patterns.<br/>
    Data from Brady et al., 2007.
    Arabidopsis primary root was cut apart in 12 (unequal) sections,
    from columella until differentiated zone. Gene expression for
    each section quantified with ATH1 Affimetrix microarrays.
    The criteria for the identification of a section-enriched gene was
    an expression in a particular section above the 175% of average 
    expression value accross all sections (from the 50% most variable probes in the array).
    SVG2 browser uses a two-tailed 
    Fisher&#39;s test in its enrichment function.
