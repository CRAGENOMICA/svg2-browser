  experiment_description:
    Arabidopsis root radial patterns.
    Data from Brady et al., 2007.
    Different transgenic expressing tissue-specific reporters
    were separated by FACS. Repressenting non-overlaping tissues
    of the Arabidopsis thaliana root. Gene expression quantified with 
    ATH1 Affimetrix microarrays. The identification of tissue-specific 
    genes according to Brady et al., 2007 cutoffs.
    SVG2 browser uses a two-tailed Fisher s test in its enrichment
    function.
